This helps to reduce the variance of the model and create a more robust model that is less likely to overfit the data."

    "- **Effect on Bias:** High-bias models may oversimplify and miss complex patterns.\n",
    "- **Effect on Variance:**  bagging may not be as effective. This is because the base learner already has low variance, and bagging may not be able to reduce the variance further.\n",
    "- **Impact on Tradeoff:** Bagging might not offer as pronounced improvements with high-bias, low-variance base learners since variance is already low. It is more effective when applied to models that benefit from increased diversity."
