    "Ans.1.Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python interpreter through a technique called \"garbage collection\".\n",
    "The garbage collector in Python uses a reference counting algorithm, which keeps track of the number of references to an object. When an object's reference count reaches zero, meaning that there are no longer any references to that object, the garbage collector frees up the memory associated with that object."
