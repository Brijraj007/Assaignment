    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns the noise in the data, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. In other words, the model is too closely fit to the training data and does not generalize well to new data. The consequences of overfitting include poor performance on new data, reduced interpretability of the model, and increased training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, we can use several techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Increasing training data: By increasing the amount of training data, we can reduce the effect of noise in the data.\n",
    "• Reducing model complexity: By reducing the complexity of the model, we can reduce the effect of noise in the data.\n",
    "• Early stopping during the training phase: By monitoring the loss over the training period and stopping as soon as loss begins to increase, we can prevent overfitting.\n",
    "• Regularization: Regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization introduce penalty terms to control model complexity.\n",
    "• Use dropout for neural networks: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out some neurons during training to prevent overfitting.\n",
